In this study, 250 mice were treated with ten different drug regimens over the course of 45 days. Tumor volume and metastatic sites were monitored every 5 days.  The objective of this work is to analyze the data and to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare in terms of appearance of metastatic sites and changes in tumor volume.
